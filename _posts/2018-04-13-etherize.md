Beginning of the year we launched our landing page and a prototype of what we promised to build, to feel out potential interest from developers and businesses in our promised service. Your support during these three months has been tremendous and as a result we released our beta version of the service that we promised you! This is our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Etherize and more features will be announced soon.

#### What we currently offer

Let’s see what you can achieve today by using the current version of Etherize. Our MVP version offers End-to-End encrypted Ethereum Wallets. The term “End-to-End encrypted Wallets” means that the private keys of your users’ Wallets are encrypted using their password, before being uploaded to our service. As a result, the Wallets we are providing you, are as secure as they can be, since only your users can use them on their devices and anywhere else they are turned into garbage. With security comes privacy as a feature, and as a result not even you (your company) or us (Etherize) can access these Wallets, and that’s a privacy feature that your users will appreciate.
