[Last time]({% post_url 2017-04-22-sql-injections %}) we accessed the user passwords of [DVWA]({% post_url 2017-04-02-dvwa-kali %}), by exploiting its *SQL Injection* vulnerability.
This time we'll use [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/), a powerful and easy to use SQL injection exploitation tool, in order to dump the whole database.
If you noticed, in the SQL injection that I retrieved the user passwords of DVWA, I "guessed" that the column in the *users* table which has the passwords is called *password*.
What I would normally do in case my guess was incorrect, would be to inject a UNION SQL query on the information schema database of the DBMS, in order to retrieve the tables and the columns of the database that I'm targeting.
Of course this is a process that is different per DBMS, and it can be automated.
And here's where sqlmap comes in the picture.
sqlmap will automate all this dull process, and through its CLI you can ask to automatically detect the injectable parameters of a web app, ask to dump whole databases, tables or columns and it even has some exploitation and password cracking automation integrated.
We'll not go through it's exploitation and password cracking features, since we'll be using [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) and [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) for these purposes, but we'll see how to exploit the same SQL injection that we exploited manually last time, do some information gathering on the server and then dump all its databases :smile:

Let's start by intercepting the HTTP request of the *SQL Injection* form, using Burp, like we did in the [HTTP login brute forcing]({% post_url 2017-04-04-hydra %}).
Copy the HTTP request body, and save in the a *request* file:

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap.png)

Now let's start sqlmap, and give as an arguments the request file that we saved earlier.
sqlmap is smart enough to parse and understand the request file, and detect the parameters that it can inspect for SQL injections:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-0.png)

sqlmap already detected that the id parameter might be injectable and vulnerable to XSS.
It also guessed (correctly) that the DBMS is MySQL and it asks if we want to skip the payloads for the rest of the DBMs, which we'll do:

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-1.png)

sqlmap says that id is injectable, great! It asks if we want to keep looking for injectable parameters, but we got what we wanted already.

sqlmap exits, but it has saved the information about the request that we analyzed.
Now let's do some information gathering, by asking for the DBMS version (if outdated it can be exploitable), the current database and the current user:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request --banner --current-user --current-db
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-3.png)

Now, let's see the tables of the dvwa database:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --tables
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-4.png)

And the columns of the user table:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa -T users --columns
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-5.png)

And let's dump the user and password column of the users table:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa -T users -C user,password --dump
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-7.png)

But why bothering with columns, when we can dump the whole dvwa database? (in our case the database is very small):

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --dump
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-8.png)

Can you see the *stored XSS* that we [pulled off earlier]({% post_url 2017-04-15-dvwa-xss %})? :wink:

Now let's list the databases:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request -D dvwa --dbs
</code></pre>

![sqlmap](/img/posts/sqlmap/sqlmap-9.png)

And let's dump them all:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
sqlmap -r request --dump-all
</code></pre>

Happy database dumping!
