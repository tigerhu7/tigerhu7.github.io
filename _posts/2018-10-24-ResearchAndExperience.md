My [**resume**](https://github.com/tigerhu7/tigerhu7.github.io/blob/master/_doc/resume.pdf?raw=true)
includes a brief introduction to my academic research and work experience.
A full list of my research and experience, including some pictures, is as following.

###  【Medical Image Processing and Analysis】

**Liver Cancer Reporting System**   
-design algorithm and write program on liver cancer reports based on ACL Li-RADS  
-integrate reporting system to software using Qt



**Liver Cancer Drug Effectiveness Evaluation**  
-compute drug permeation on tumor i.e. Ktrans value  
-evaluate effectiveness through statistics    


**Coronary Artery Segmentation and 3D Visualization**  
-detect and segment coronary arteries from CT Angiography images  
-retrieve coronary arteries, reconstruct them in 3D  
-calculate geometries for blood flow modelling  
-visualize narrowness and friction flow rate

**Aorta Segmentation and Flow Simulation**  
-segment aorta of ascend, aortic arch and aorta of descend from Phase-Constrast MRI   
-reconstruct them in 3D  
-retrieve velocity vector field from velocity Phases, and optimize velocity field   
-simulate flow in 3D, compute FFR, OSI, WSS and ect.

**Use Superpixel on Brain Tumor Detection**   
-use SLICO to generate superpixels on brain MR image   
-detect abnormal/tumor region using simulated annealing method    

**Brain Tumor Detection using Asymmetry**  
-generate Homogeneous Transform Matrix  
-compute optimal parameters  
-estimate tumor position using symmetry measures  

### 【Shape Deformation】

**Geodesic Shooting Method in Shape Deformation**  
-set up geodesic shooting equations for Large Diffeomorphic Deformation Metric Mapping  
-using various kernels/filters, to compare the results     



### 【Numerical Computation】  
**Use Reaction-Advection-Diffusion Equation to simulate brain tumor growth**  
-set up reaction-advection-diffusion equation to simulate tumor growth  
-find optimal parameters  
-generate meshgrid and use Finite Element Method to find numerical solution  


### 【General Image Processing】   
**Beef Marbling Grading**  
-segment ribeye using active contour method  
-utilize superpixel to obtain blocks, then distinguish fat and lean blocks  
-calculate far portion, fat blocks   portion and fractal dimension to get marbling grades  


### 【Teaching Experience】   
**Teaching Assistant**  
-I have been instruct students in problem session for 5 years at University of Texas at Dallas  
-I instructed Calculus(1,2,3), Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equation, Calculus(Cohort), Multivariable Calculus  
-my average rating from students is 4.4 out of 5
