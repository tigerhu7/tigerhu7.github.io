I like traveling a lot, especially by cars. I picked up this habit when I was studying in the States. Often, I drive out of town for two or three days, yet, I did spend weeks of time on the road. My record is 23 days. One achievement I am so proud of is that my footprints are left on every contiguous states, that is all states except Alaska and Hawaii. Among them, two long-distance roadtrips I took almost cover each half of the states.
To me, roadtrip is not only a way for fun, but also one way to know the world better.
