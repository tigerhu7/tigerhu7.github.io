As I [wrote](https://panossakkos.github.io/tech/2015/06/27/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) before,
I wanted to open-source the current theme because I believe that it adds value to the existing Jekyll themes.
Also, I feel that I owe it back to the community, because without the existing code that I forked, I would never have the current blog.
And I love this blog.

The value of *{ Personal }* is that it enables blogging in the [Timeline](https://kirbyt.github.io/timeline-jekyll-theme/) theme
(a mashup of the popular [Agency](https://y7kim.github.io/agency-jekyll-theme/) and [Grayscale](https://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale) themes), it personalizes more the theme by focusing on its owner,
it makes it easy to customize the website from Jekyll's config and it offers a cool [404](https://panossakkos.github.io/404.html) page.

The visual touches that I believe that make the theme a bit more personal,
is the owner's picture in the home page, and the blurred background, because it forces the eye to focus on the owner's photo.
Moreover, Grayscale's neutral glyphicon of the header is replaced by a black and white version of the favicon.

The repo lives [here](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) and it's under [pull request](https://github.com/mattvh/jekyllthemes/pull/134) for [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org) and indexed in Jekyll's themes [wiki](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes).

Of course, the theme will evolve over the time and as soon as time permits, the blog will support discovery with hashtags.

Don't forget to support the repo by starring it :wink:
